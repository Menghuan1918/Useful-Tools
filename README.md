Some useful applets/scripting tools, generally written in bash or python, no or only a small number of external libraries are used.

Generally, for ease of operation, the program is a single file and is designed to run on multiple platforms.

## Coding

### [Quick compile and run lex file](Coding/flex/Run_flex_file.md) 

With the current folder as the startup directory, select a subfolder or lex file under the current folder, compile and run.


### [Quick automated interaction with DOSBox (with simple variable feature)](Coding/dosbox/Run_DOS_box.md) 

Interact with DOSBox in scripted form on Linux.

### [Testing API response speed in OpenAI format](Coding/llm/Speed_test.md)

Attached are the speeds of ollama/openai/deepseek/yimodel/wispspectrum/groq that I've tested

## File processing

### [Batch correction of incorrect file extensions](Files/Type/Correct_extension.md) 

Batch corrects files with incorrect suffixes, e.g. a file that is clearly a `webm` file but has a `webp` suffix.

# Other
Am continually revising some previously written applets and uploading them (they weren't really written in a standardised way before .....).
